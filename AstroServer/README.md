# AstroServer

AstroServer, a Luau-based server modularization script. A technology to integrate multiple Lua scripts into one script and multiple modules. 

With the AstroServer, users can easily access additional modules by simply typing `_G.ReturnServerModule(name)` in their modules or waiting for them by using `_G.WaitForServerPlugin(name, overrideTime)`. 

For the time being, AstroTechnologies is currently giving for free our `N/A` module that is working with `AstroServer`

At present, **AstroServer** has the capability to prioritize certain modules over others. To accomplish this, all you need to do is create a folder called "Priority" within the AstroServer directory, and then move any modules you wish to initialize first into that folder.

AstroServer is an **open source** project and is being developed by **CodeSaviour#9999**.


*Other AstroTechnologies projects are **not open sourced** and are actively being developed for Project Enclosed on roblox.*


ChatGPT's opinion on modularization: 
`As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs since I am not a conscious being. However, based on my understanding of software development practices, I can say that modularization is generally considered a good practice. Breaking code into smaller, more manageable modules can improve code quality, maintainability, and reusability, which can lead to a more efficient development process and better software overall. However, like any development practice, there are pros and cons to modularization, and its effectiveness depends on the specific project and development team.`
