# AstroServer

AstroServer, a Lua-based server modularization script. A technology to integrate multiple Lua scripts into one script and multiple modules. 

With the AstroServer, users can easily access additional modules by simply typing `_G.ReturnServerModule(name)` in their modules or waiting for them by using `_G.WaitForServerPlugin(name, overrideTime)`. 

For the time being, AstroTechnologies is currently giving for free our `PlayerMisc_V2` module that is working with `AstroServer`

AstroServer is an **open source** project and is being developed by our experienced team led by **CodeSaviour#9999**. At AstroTechnologies, we are committed to developing innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients.
