# AstroServer

AstroServer, a Luau-based server modularization script. A technology to integrate multiple Lua scripts into one script and multiple modules. 

With the AstroServer, users can easily access additional modules by simply typing `_G.ReturnServerModule(name)` in their modules or waiting for them by using `_G.WaitForServerPlugin(name, overrideTime)`. 

For the time being, AstroTechnologies is currently giving for free our `PlayerMisc_V2` module that is working with `AstroServer`

**AstroServer** currently has the ability to give other modules a bigger priority over other, simply create folder named "Priority" under the AstroServer, and place every module you want to initialize first there.

AstroServer is an **open source** project and is being developed by **CodeSaviour#9999**.


*Other AstroTechnologies projects are **not open sourced** and are actively being developed for Project Enclosed on roblox.*
